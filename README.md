# Drone Recon Mission Mini-Game

*Created by: Reza Maliki Akbar (maliki_borneo)*

## Description
Drone Recon Mission is a 2D stealth action game built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The player pilots a reconnaissance drone through 10 increasingly difficult levels. The objective is to collect all required data packets in each level while avoiding enemy detection and environmental hazards, and then proceed to the extraction zone before running out of time or fuel.

This project was developed for the **Capstone Project - Student Developer Initiative IBM SkillsBuild (Code Optimization and Generation Using IBM Granite) x Hacktiv8**, focusing on the "Mini-Games" category. It is fully responsive and playable on both desktop (keyboard) and mobile (touchscreen) devices.

## Technologies Used
* **HTML5:** For the core structure and layout of the game.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including the retro terminal aesthetic, animations, UI elements, and responsive design via media queries.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** For all game logic, including player controls (keyboard and touch), enemy AI, physics, collision detection, and state management.
* **Browser `localStorage`:** Used to persist the high-score leaderboard on the player's computer.

## Features
* **Mobile & Desktop Ready:** A fully responsive layout and on-screen touch controls make the game playable on any device.
* **10-Level Campaign:** Progress through 10 unique levels with increasing difficulty.
* **Complex Objectives:** Players must collect all data packets before the extraction zone becomes active.
* **Diverse Enemy Types:** Face static and moving radars, sweeping searchlights, patrolling jets, and locking SAM (Surface-to-Air Missile) sites.
* **Resource Management:** Manage a limited fuel supply that depletes with movement and a strict time limit for each level.
* **Lives & Scoring System:** Start with 3 lives, find bonus lives in later levels, and earn a score based on performance.
* **Persistent Leaderboard:** The game saves the top 5 scores locally, encouraging replayability.
* **Interactive UI:** A clean, themed interface provides all necessary mission intel, including a dynamic legend and status updates.
